-The addresses of the tokens are extracted from the ABI.json of https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/

-In the environment file you will find the link of the infura.rinkeby gateway for the connection to the ethereum test network, as well as the addresses of the buyer account with ETH faucets and its private key to achieve the simulation in the blockchain network.

-At the end of the program execution, the hash of the token purchase test transaction is printed to simulate the binding curve to review the search for information also at https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/

For the test, a binary was implemented that executes transaction in contracts deployed in the ethereum test network with websocket infura rinkeby, made swap of ETH faucets to DAI (ERC20 base) is carried out with UniSwap V2 technique to simulate the purchase of tokens relating the basic bond curve methods
